# kubernetes-postfix-relay-host
A SMTP relay host for transactional based emails from within a k8s cluster.
 
## Overview
This repository contains Kubernetes config files and a docker image to easily set up a SMTP relay for services such as SendGrid.

## Background
We needed a simple docker image that can be configured with env vars. Also, the functionality is easily overridden by providing an alternate init script. 

# Quickstart
Run on docker
```
docker run --rm -it -p 2525:25 \
	-e TX_SMTP_RELAY_HOST="[smtp.sendgrid.net]:587" \
	-e TX_SMTP_RELAY_MYHOSTNAME=tx-smtp-relay.yourhost.com \
	-e TX_SMTP_RELAY_USERNAME=username \
	-e TX_SMTP_RELAY_PASSWORD=password \
	applariat/tx-smtp-relay

```
